A Bash tool that helps you spot known traces of the September 2025 and November 2025 npm supply-chain attacks—including the Shai-Hulud self-replicating worm, the chalk/debug crypto-theft incident, and the "Shai-Hulud: The Second Coming" fake Bun runtime attack. It cross-checks 979+ confirmed bad package versions across multiple campaigns and checks for the most relevant red flags in your project.

## Overview

Covers multiple npm supply chain attacks from September 2025 and November 2025:

### **Chalk/Debug Crypto Theft Attack** (September 8, 2025)
- **Scope**: 18+ packages with 2+ billion weekly downloads
- **Attack**: Cryptocurrency wallet address replacement in browsers
- **Duration**: ~2 hours before detection
- **Packages**: chalk, debug, ansi-styles, color-*, supports-*, and others
- **Method**: XMLHttpRequest hijacking to steal crypto transactions

### **Shai-Hulud Self-Replicating Worm** (September 14-16, 2025)
- **Scope**: 517+ packages across multiple namespaces
- **Attack**: Credential harvesting and self-propagation
- **Method**: Uses Trufflehog to scan for secrets, publishes stolen data to GitHub
- **Propagation**: Self-replicates using stolen npm tokens
- **Packages**: @ctrl/*, @crowdstrike/*, @operato/*, and many others

### **Shai-Hulud: The Second Coming** (November 24, 2025)
- **Scope**: 300+ packages with millions of weekly downloads
- **Attack**: Fake Bun runtime installation with credential harvesting
- **Method**: Uses fake `setup_bun.js` preinstall hook to download and execute TruffleHog
- **Exfiltration**: Creates GitHub Actions runners named "SHA1HULUD" and repositories with "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming" descriptions
- **Packages**: @zapier/*, @posthog/*, @asyncapi/*, @postman/*, @ensdomains/*, and many others
- **Files**: `setup_bun.js`, `bun_environment.js` (10MB+ obfuscated payload), `actionsSecrets.json` (double Base64 encoded)
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/formatter_*.yml` files using SHA1HULUD runners

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Cobenian/shai-hulud-detect
cd shai-hulud-detect

# Make the script executable
chmod +x shai-hulud-detector.sh

# Scan your project for Shai-Hulud indicators
./shai-hulud-detector.sh /path/to/your/project

# For comprehensive security scanning
./shai-hulud-detector.sh --paranoid /path/to/your/project

# Check exit code for CI/CD integration
./shai-hulud-detector.sh /path/to/your/project
echo "Exit code: $?"  # 0=clean, 1=high-risk, 2=medium-risk
```

**CI/CD Integration**: The script returns appropriate exit codes (0=clean, 1=high-risk, 2=medium-risk) for seamless integration into automated security pipelines.

## What it Detects

### High Risk Indicators
- **Malicious workflow files**: `shai-hulud-workflow.yml` files in `.github/workflows/` (September 2025) and `formatter_*.yml` files using SHA1HULUD runners (November 2025)
- **Known malicious file hashes**: Files matching any of 7 SHA-256 hashes from different Shai-Hulud worm variants (V1-V7), sourced from [Socket.dev's comprehensive attack analysis](https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages)
- **November 2025 Bun attack files**: `setup_bun.js` (fake Bun runtime installer) and `bun_environment.js` (10MB+ obfuscated credential harvesting payload)
- **Compromised package versions**: Specific versions of 979+ packages from multiple attacks (September & November 2025)
- **Suspicious postinstall hooks**: Package.json files with postinstall scripts containing curl, wget, eval commands, or fake Bun installation (`"preinstall": "node setup_bun.js"`)
- **Trufflehog activity**: Files containing trufflehog references, credential scanning patterns, or November 2025 enhanced patterns (automated TruffleHog download and execution)
- **Shai-Hulud repositories**: Git repositories named "Shai-Hulud" (used for data exfiltration) or with "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming" descriptions
- **Secrets exfiltration files**: `actionsSecrets.json` files with double Base64 encoded credentials (November 2025)
- **SHA1HULUD GitHub Actions runners**: GitHub Actions workflows using malicious runners for credential theft

### Medium Risk Indicators
- **Suspicious content patterns**: References to `webhook.site` and the malicious endpoint `bb8ca5f6-4175-45d2-b042-fc9ebb8170b7`
- **Suspicious git branches**: Branches named "shai-hulud"
- **Semver pattern matching**: Packages that could become compromised during `npm update` due to caret (^) or tilde (~) version patterns

### Low Risk Indicators
- **Namespace warnings**: Packages from namespaces known to be affected (@ctrl, @crowdstrike, @art-ws, @ngx, @nativescript-community) but at safe versions

### Package Detection Method

The script loads a list of the compromised packages from an external file (`compromised-packages.txt`) which contains:
- **979+ confirmed compromised package versions** with exact version numbers (571+ from September 2025 + 300+ from November 2025)
- **18+ affected namespaces** for broader detection of packages from compromised maintainer accounts

### Maintaining and Updating the Package List

**Important**: The Shai-Hulud attack was self-replicating, meaning new compromised packages may still be discovered. The compromised packages list is stored in `compromised-packages.txt` for easy maintenance:

- **Format**: `package_name:version` (one per line)
- **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are ignored
- **Updates**: The file can be updated as new compromised packages are discovered
- **Fallback**: If the file is missing, the script uses a core embedded list

### Staying Updated on New Compromised Packages

Check these security advisories regularly for newly discovered compromised packages:

- **[StepSecurity Blog](https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised)** - Original comprehensive analysis
- **[Semgrep Security Advisory](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/security-advisory-npm-packages-using-secret-scanning-tools-to-steal-credentials/)** - Detailed technical analysis
- **[JFrog Security Research](https://jfrog.com/blog/shai-hulud-npm-supply-chain-attack-new-compromised-packages-detected/)** - Ongoing detection of new packages
- **[Wiz Security Blog](https://www.wiz.io/blog/shai-hulud-npm-supply-chain-attack)** - Attack analysis with package appendix
- **[Socket.dev Blog](https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages)** - CrowdStrike package analysis
- **[HelixGuard](https://helixguard.ai/blog/malicious-sha1hulud-2025-11-24)** - Second Coming analysis

### How to Add Newly Discovered Packages

1. Check the security advisories above for new compromised packages
2. Add them to `compromised-packages.txt` in the format `package_name:version`
3. Test the script to ensure detection works
4. Consider contributing updates back to this repository

**Coverage Note**: Multiple September and November 2025 attacks affected 979+ packages total. Our detection aims to provide **comprehensive coverage** across the Shai-Hulud worm (517+ packages), Chalk/Debug crypto theft (26+ packages), and "Shai-Hulud: The Second Coming" fake Bun runtime attack (300+ packages). Combined with namespace-based detection and enhanced attack pattern recognition, this provides excellent protection against these sophisticated supply chain compromises.

### Core vs Paranoid Mode

**Core Mode (Default)**
- Focuses specifically on Shai-Hulud attack indicators
- Recommended for most users checking for this specific threat
- Clean, focused output with minimal false positives

**Paranoid Mode (`--paranoid`)**
- Includes all core Shai-Hulud detection PLUS additional security checks
- Adds typosquatting detection and network exfiltration pattern analysis
- **Important**: Paranoid features are general security tools, not specific to Shai-Hulud
- May produce more false positives from legitimate code
- Useful for comprehensive security auditing

## Requirements

- macOS or Unix-like system
- Bash shell
- Standard Unix tools: `find`, `grep`, `shasum`

## Output Interpretation

### Clean System
```
✅ No indicators of Shai-Hulud compromise detected.
Your system appears clean from this specific attack.
```

### Compromised System
The script will show:
- **🚨 HIGH RISK**: Definitive indicators of compromise
- **⚠️ MEDIUM RISK**: Suspicious patterns requiring manual review
- **Summary**: Count of issues found

### What to Do if Issues are Found

#### High Risk Issues
- **Immediate action required**
- Update or remove compromised packages
- Review and remove malicious workflow files
- Scan for credential theft
- Consider full system audit

#### Medium Risk Issues
- **Manual investigation needed**
- Review flagged files for legitimacy
- Check if webhook.site usage is intentional
- Verify git branch purposes

## Exit Codes for CI/CD Integration

The script returns specific exit codes to enable proper CI/CD pipeline integration:

- **Exit Code 0**: Clean system - no significant security findings
- **Exit Code 1**: High-risk findings detected - immediate action required
- **Exit Code 2**: Medium-risk findings detected - manual investigation needed

### CI/CD Pipeline Examples

#### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Security Scan with Shai-Hulud Detector
  run: |
    chmod +x ./shai-hulud-detector.sh
    ./shai-hulud-detector.sh .
  # Pipeline will automatically fail on exit codes 1 or 2
```

#### GitLab CI
```yaml
security_scan:
  script:
    - chmod +x ./shai-hulud-detector.sh
    - ./shai-hulud-detector.sh .
  # Job fails automatically on non-zero exit codes
```

#### Jenkins
```groovy
stage('Security Scan') {
  steps {
    sh '''
      chmod +x ./shai-hulud-detector.sh
      ./shai-hulud-detector.sh .
    '''
  }
  // Build fails automatically on non-zero exit codes
}
```

#### Custom Handling by Exit Code
```bash
#!/bin/bash
./shai-hulud-detector.sh .
exit_code=$?

case $exit_code in
    0) echo "✅ Security scan passed - no issues found" ;;
    1) echo "🚨 CRITICAL: High-risk security issues found - blocking deployment"
       exit 1 ;;
    2) echo "⚠️ WARNING: Medium-risk issues found - review required"
       # Could choose to continue with warnings
       ;;
esac
```

```

### New Detection Capabilities (v2.7.5)

The latest version includes enhanced detection for previously undetected attack techniques from the Koi.ai "Second Coming" analysis:

#### Semver Wildcard Support
- **Test Case**: `test-cases/semver-wildcards/`
- **Validates**: Proper parsing of version patterns like "4.x", "1.2.x", "x.x.x"
- **Background**: Fixes parsing errors that occurred when the script encountered wildcard version patterns
- **Expected**: Clean execution without syntax errors when processing wildcard patterns

#### Discussion Workflow Detection
- **Test Case**: `test-cases/discussion-workflows/`
- **Validates**: Detection of malicious GitHub Actions workflows that trigger on issue/PR discussion events
- **Background**: Stealth persistence technique where workflows activate when legitimate users comment on issues/PRs
- **Expected**: CRITICAL risk alerts for workflows with `on: discussion` triggers containing suspicious activity

#### Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Runner Detection
- **Test Case**: `test-cases/github-actions-runners/`
- **Validates**: Detection of persistent backdoors installed as self-hosted GitHub Actions runners
- **Background**: Attackers install runners in `.dev-env/` directories with SHA1HULUD naming patterns for persistent access
- **Expected**: CRITICAL risk alerts for runner configurations with malicious naming patterns in development directories

#### File Hash Verification Enhancement
- **Test Case**: `test-cases/hash-verification/`
- **Validates**: SHA256 hash verification against known malicious file signatures
- **Background**: Enhanced detection of malicious files by their cryptographic fingerprints rather than just filename patterns
- **Expected**: Accurate identification of malicious files by hash, with clean files passing verification

#### Destructive Payload Pattern Detection
- **Test Case**: `test-cases/destructive-patterns/`
- **Validates**: Detection of destructive fallback commands that activate when credential theft fails
- **Background**: From Koi.ai report - when credential exfiltration fails, malware deletes files as destructive fallback
- **Expected**: CRITICAL risk alerts for patterns like `rm -rf $HOME/*`, `fs.rmSync(..., {recursive: true})`, `Remove-Item -Recurse`
- **Coverage**: Cross-platform destruction patterns (Linux/macOS/Windows)

### Paranoid Mode Testing

The `--paranoid` flag enables additional security checks beyond Shai-Hulud-specific detection:

- **Typosquatting Detection**: Identifies packages with names similar to popular packages (e.g., "raect" instead of "react", "lodsh" instead of "lodash")
- **Network Exfiltration Patterns**: Detects suspicious domains (webhook.site, pastebin.com), hardcoded IP addresses, WebSocket connections to external endpoints
- **Enhanced Security Auditing**: Useful for comprehensive project security reviews

**Note**: Paranoid mode may produce more false positives from legitimate code patterns, so review findings carefully.

### Lockfile-Aware Detection (v2.6.0+)

The script now intelligently handles projects with lockfiles to reduce false positives:

- **Lockfile Detection**: Automatically detects package-lock.json, yarn.lock, and pnpm-lock.yaml files
- **Actual Version Checking**: When semver ranges could match compromised versions, checks the actual installed version from lockfiles
- **Smart Risk Assessment**:
  - **HIGH RISK**: Lockfile contains exact compromised version (immediate threat)
  - **LOW RISK**: Lockfile contains safe version (protected by lockfile, but avoid updates)
  - **MEDIUM RISK**: No lockfile present (potential update risk)

**Example**: If your package.json has `debug@^4.0.1` (which could match compromised `debug@4.4.2`), but your lockfile pins to `debug@4.0.1`, you'll see a LOW RISK message explaining that your current installation is safe.

This feature addresses Issue #42 and eliminates confusion for users with older projects that have established lockfiles.

## How it Works

The script performs these comprehensive checks:

1. **Package Database Loading**: Loads the complete list of 1,677+ compromised packages from `compromised-packages.txt` (September & November 2025, plus 953 packages from Koi.ai "Second Coming" analysis)
2. **Workflow Detection**: Searches for `shai-hulud-workflow.yml` files (September 2025) and `formatter_*.yml` files with SHA1HULUD runners (November 2025)
3. **Hash Verification**: Calculates SHA-256 hashes of JavaScript/JSON files against 7 known malicious bundle.js variants representing the complete evolution of the Shai-Hulud worm (V1-V7)
4. **November 2025 Bun Attack Detection**: Identifies `setup_bun.js` (fake Bun installer) and `bun_environment.js` (obfuscated payload) files with enhanced SHA256 hash verification
5. **Package Analysis**: Parses `package.json` files for specific compromised versions, affected namespaces, and fake Bun preinstall hooks
6. **Postinstall Hook Detection**: Identifies suspicious postinstall scripts including fake Bun installation patterns (`"preinstall": "node setup_bun.js"`)
7. **Content Scanning**: Greps for suspicious URLs, webhook endpoints, and malicious patterns
8. **Cryptocurrency Theft Detection**: Identifies wallet address replacement patterns, XMLHttpRequest hijacking, and known crypto theft functions from the September 8 attack
9. **Enhanced Trufflehog Activity Detection**: Looks for credential scanning tools, secret harvesting, and November 2025 automated TruffleHog download patterns
10. **Git Analysis**: Checks for suspicious branch names and repository names
11. **Repository Detection**: Identifies "Shai-Hulud" repositories and "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming" repository descriptions
12. **Secrets Exfiltration Detection**: Identifies `actionsSecrets.json` files with double Base64 encoded credentials
13. **GitHub Actions Runner Detection**: Identifies malicious SHA1HULUD runners in GitHub Actions workflows
14. **Discussion Workflow Detection**: Identifies malicious GitHub Actions workflows that trigger on discussion events (a stealth persistence technique where workflows activate when issues/PRs receive comments)
15. **Self-Hosted Runner Detection**: Detects persistent backdoor installations via self-hosted GitHub Actions runners stored in `.dev-env/` directories with SHA1HULUD naming patterns
16. **Destructive Payload Detection**: Identifies destructive fallback patterns that activate when credential theft fails, including `rm -rf $HOME/*`, `fs.rmSync(..., {recursive: true})`, `Remove-Item -Recurse`, and cross-platform destruction commands
17. **Package Integrity Checking**: Analyzes package-lock.json and yarn.lock files for compromised packages and suspicious modifications

## Limitations

- **Hash Detection**: Only detects files with exact matches to the 7 known malicious bundle.js hashes
- **Package Versions**: Detects specific compromised versions and namespace warnings, but new compromised versions may not be detected
- **False Positives**: Legitimate use of webhook.site, Trufflehog for security, or postinstall hooks will trigger alerts
- **Worm Evolution**: The self-replicating nature means new variants may emerge with different signatures
- **Coverage**: Covers known compromised packages from major September 2025 and November 2025 attacks
- **Package Integrity**: Relies on lockfile analysis to detect compromised packages, but sophisticated attacks may evade detection

## Contributing

If you discover additional IoCs or compromised packages related to the Shai-Hulud attack, please update the arrays in the script and test thoroughly.

## Security Note

This script is for **detection only**. It does not:
- Automatically remove malicious code
- Fix compromised packages
- Prevent future attacks

Always verify findings manually and take appropriate remediation steps.

## Latest Threat Intelligence Updates

### s1ngularity/Nx Connection (September 2025)
Recent investigations have revealed a potential connection between the Shai-Hulud campaign and the Nx package ecosystem:
- **Repository Migration Patterns**: Attackers are using repositories with "-migration" suffixes to distribute malicious packages
- **Advanced Package Integrity Checks**: Double base64-encoded `data.json` files have been discovered in compromised package versions
- **Additional Compromised Versions**: `tinycolor@4.1.1` and `tinycolor@4.1.2` have been identified as compromised
- **New Package Targets**: `angulartics2` and `koa2-swagger-ui` packages have been added to the compromised list

### Enhanced Detection Capabilities (v2.5.0)
The script now includes:
- **Fixed lockfile false positives**: Improved package version extraction to prevent incorrect flagging of safe packages (fixes issue #37)
- **Robust lockfile parsing**: Uses block-based JSON parsing instead of proximity-based grep to accurately extract package versions
- **Context-aware XMLHttpRequest detection**: Reduces false positives for legitimate framework code (React Native, Next.js)
- **Improved risk stratification**: XMLHttpRequest modifications now properly classified based on context and crypto patterns
- **Parallel processing optimization**: ~20% performance improvement with semver pattern matching
- **Duplicate-free package database**: Cleaned 600+ unique compromised package entries
- Repository migration pattern detection
- Package-lock.json integrity verification
- Context-aware Trufflehog detection to reduce false positives
- Risk level classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) for better triage
